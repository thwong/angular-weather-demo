# angular-weather-demo
Demo showing weather information with angular framework.

This is a very lightweight demo that showcases how one could construct a modularized angular application by separating its controllers and models (services).  In this example, the application has a single controller which utilizes two domain classes to get the user location, and its local weather.

For ease of reading, both the controller and domain classes are put in the same JS file. In real world application, these classes and its view template should be separated into individual files for better maintainability.
